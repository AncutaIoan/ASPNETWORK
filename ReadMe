Here is my ASP.NET local project. In here i had used Entity,Migrations,Identity just so i can make a raw and unpolished(CSS missing due to lack of creativity and time).
Login for admin: admin@gmail.com !1Admin (in case someone wants to play the hero)
Types of users : User, Member,Leader,Admin

Once a user creates a new team, he becames Leader of that team, he can add project/members/tasks/comments and has full control of this team.
Once someone adds  you in a team, you became member of that team, you can view your task and modify the status
The admin has full coverage of the app, he can delete, update or even remove someones leadership if needed.
